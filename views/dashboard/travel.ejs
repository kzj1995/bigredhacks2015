            <h3>Traveling by Greyhound</h3>

                convenient option would
                be to take a taxi to Kennedy Hall. Some taxi options include <a href="http://www.ithacataxi.biz/"

                walk from the Greyhound terminal to the Green St
                @ Commons stop. Get off at <em>Rockefeller Hall</em>. From Rockefeller Hall, it is a 3 minute

            <h3>Traveling by Car</h3>

            <p>Note: Because it's Homecoming Weekend at Cornell, the parking situation is especially difficult.
                Additionally, we anticipate several road closures on Friday and Saturday on the southern part of
                campus around the football field. Note that Hoy Garage will be CLOSED.</p>

            <p class="long-text">If you are traveling by car, you can park your car at <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/A+Lot/@42.4481187,-76.4829308,10.26z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sA+Lot!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x83c1e76e6ceea578">A
                    Lot</a>. You will not need a parking permit to park there after 5pm on Friday
                through Sunday; however, if you plan on staying longer, you will need a temporary permit
                starting 7:30AM on Monday. More details can be found on the <a

                violations.</p>

            <p class="long-text">If A Lot is filled, there are several garages in the Commons that are inexpensive
                and also offer free parking during off-hours. The TCAT, our local bus company, provides several
                routes (we recommend route 30) that run from the Commons to the center of campus. You can take route
